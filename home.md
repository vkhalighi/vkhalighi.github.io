Welcome to my home page! I try to post recent progress in my 
research and preprints of papers here.

I try to learn the core areas of modern mathematics exhaustively; 
then I try to digest that knowledge by posting on [Elements of Mathematics](https://math.ac.nz). Elements of Mathematics is also 
available under the alternative domain [https://maths.ac.nz](https://maths.ac.nz).

I also try to learn the core areas of computer science exhaustively; 
then I try to digest that knowledge by posting on [Elements of Computer Science](https://cs.ac.nz).

I love telling stories through mathematics and mathematical proofs
provide a wonderful opportunity to tell exciting stories.

I am mostly interested in algebraic geometry and related areas but also
enjoy mathematics outside algebraic geometry that connects various
parts of mathematics together.

I am also interested in theoretical computer science, particularly
[The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP)](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) but also
enjoy other areas of computer science that are closely related to 
mathematics. I am also interested in computer typesetting and
